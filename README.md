## Description 
This progressive Budget Tracker enables a user to log transactions both online and offline.  This way, a user can keep track of their funds even when the internet is down or during travel.  The app will sync back up once the internet comes back online and the data entered while offline will not be lost and the balance is always accurate.

## Installation
1. Run ``` npm install``` to install all required dependencies: mongoose, morgan, compression, lite-server, and express. 
2. Run the command ``` npm run start ``` to start the server

## Usage
After intalling all necessary dependencies, the user can simply begin logging their transactions by entering a transaction name and amount, and then either adding or subtracting the funds from the total budget displayed at the top. As the user logs their transactions, the handy chart at the bottom will graph the data and a list will display the transaction history.
